      commit. Also rewrote to use assert_larry_equal plus general clean up.

    * afunc.py(fillforward_partially), afunc.py(push), deflarry.py(push),
      tests/deflarry_test.py, tests/more_test.py, tests/test_3d.py: Rename
      the array function fillforward_partially to push to match the name of
      larry method.

      functions in afunc.py.
      
    * util/tests/testing_test.py: New module for unit tests of the
      assert_larry_equal function.
      
    * tests/more_test.py: Turn on 3d function check (was commented out since
      many functions were previously 2d only). Add nanmedian to the list of
      functions to test; remove covMissing from the list. Remove 0.0 from test
      array so that geometric_mean doesn't complain.

2010-04-25 Keith

    * util/scipy.py(nanstd): Ported bug fix from scipy.

    * tests/larry_axis_test.py: Removed negative axis test for the insertaxis

      larry).

    * tests/larry_axis_test.py: Added a new module to unit test all larry
      methods that take axis as input. The unit tests make sure that axis=-1
      and axis=1 give the same results for a 2d larry. These unit tests found
      many bugs. I haven't fixed them yet.

2010-04-22 Keith

    * deflarry.py(lix), deflarry.py(Getitemlabel): Moved the Getitemlabel
      class code out of the lix method. Now the class is defined at import
      instead of each time lix is called. Much faster.

2010-02-12 Keith

    * deflarry.py(lix): Reverse update of code comment in previous commit.

    * deflarry.py(lix): Update code comment to match code.

      docs.

    * deflarry.py(sortaxis), deflarry.py(lix), doc/source/intro.rst: Handle
      shapes that contain a zero such as (0,) and (2, 0, 3). Although sortaxis
      now handles shapes with zero, the call to lix that sortaxis makes will
      fail because lix does not handle shapes with zero (except for (0,)).
      Added a check for zero shapes in lix.
      
    * tests/empty_larry_test.py(test_empty): Added empty array unit tests for
      sortaxis and flip axis.

      tests/empty_larry_test.py, doc/source/intro.rst: Bug #518442. sum, std,
      and var returned NaN for shapes that contain zero, e.g., (2, 0, 3).
      Added unit tests.

    * tests/deflarry_nose_test.py(test_conversion), doc/source/intro.rst:
      Unit tests for the conversion methods: totuples, tolist, todict,

      convert to float. Add unit tests.

    * tests/deflarry_test.py(Test_calc): Bug fix: remove in place operations
      in unit tests of zscore. What was I thinking? The problem is if the

      float when output is a scalar.

      respectively.

    * util/scipy.py: New module that contains all the SciPy functions needed
      by la. Now la no longer depends on SciPy (well, except for gaussian
      normalization in the ranking function.)

    * deflarry.py, tests/more_test.py, afunc.py, README, util/scipy.py:
      Remove SciPy dependency.

      already aligned. Big speed up for when larrys are already aligned.
      Added corresponding unit tests.
      
    * deflarry.py(__rdiv__): I could not come up with an example that uses
      rdiv when when other is a larry. So I removed the code and set a
      runtimeError.

      functions for reuse and easier testing. Added a merge method to IO.
    
    * deflarry.py(sign): Typo in doc string.    

2010-01-10 Keith

      already exists. This makes the io more dictionary like. Added notes and
      examples to the doc string. Sort by key name in repr.

    * io/io.py, README, __init__.py: Remove npz archive format. Just
      concentrate on one format (hdf5) for now. Also made __repr__ work
      without needing to load the data.

    * io/hdf5.py, io/npz.py: Remove these modules that contained save and load
      functions for hdf5 and npz format. I now use a dictionary-like

    * deflarry.py, la/tests/afunc_arr_test.py, la/tests/more_test.py,
      afunc.py: Renamed sector_rank, sector_mean, sector_median, unique_sector
      to group_rank, group_mean, group_median, unique_group to match larry
      method names. Less confusion. Added doc strings. Made unique_group
      faster. Added optional import norm and ties to group_rank.

    * deflarry.py(sign), tests/deflarry_nose_test.py,
      tests/deflarry_test.py: New methods and corresponding unit tests.

    * deflarry.py(__len__): Removed new method. It results in a lot of test
      failures of the binary functions. Odd.

      tests to ranking tests.

      deflarry.py(__ror__): New functions.

2009-12-23 Josef

    * add axis back into lastrank (is a reduce operation but keeps dimension)

2009-11-19 Josef

    * convert movingrank and lastrank to use arrays
      API break: lastrank returns 1d not 2d column vector
      1 test, larry.lastrank_1, fails, maybe change back to 2d
      
    * fix larry.movingsum tests, all tests pass again
    
    * convert movingsum_forward to using arrays, add dropped rows/columns
      back into movingsum, correct shape in afun tests, deflarry_test for
      movingsum are wrong now
      
    * convert geometric mean to using arrays, maintain same dimension
    * convert sector functions to using arrays
    
    * add afunc sector functions to return type tests, decorate.

      additional minor changes
      
    * convert covMissing to use arrays internally, switch decorator
    
    * decorate remaining afunc functions with wrong return type,

      rename M in covMissing (shadows matlib M), 
      remove some boilerplate in more_test, skip 3d tests for now

    * add more_test.py: check return type, and 3d input,
      (errors=10, failures=8) out of 48 tests

    * changing some methods of larry to not use matrix conversion breaks test.
      add decorator to quantile and covMissing, add one test for larry.cov,
      fix errors in covMissing, all current tests pass
      add missing tests for afunc.sector_dummy and afunc.unique_sector 

2009-11-18 Josef

    * apply @wraptomatrix1 to remaining afunc functions, now all tests pass for
      array and for matrices, rename afunc_arr_test.py so it is picked up by nose.
      some larry functions still convert to matrices

    * add decorator module (from pypi), add decorator to convert to matrix,
      use with afunc.ranking, afunc_arr_tes_.py:Test_ranking and deflarry_test pass

    * add afunc_arr_tes_.py: raw translation of afunc_test for arrays instead
      of matrices, 30 out of 54 tests with error or failures

    * add nosetesting via numpy, fix one import error in tests after relocation
    
    * change/deepen directory structure

2009-09-29 Keith

    * core/deflarry.py: Made it possible to subclass larry without having it
      revert back to a regular larry when certain methods are called. I did
      that by changing larry(x, label) to type(self)(x, label) in many places.

2009-09-24 Keith

    * afunc.py(nanmedian): There were two nanmedian functions: one that used
      numpy matrices and one taken from scipy that uses numpy arrays. I
      deleted the matrx version.

    * svn_export.py(svn_export): Fixed typo in path.

    * svn_export.py: Added a module that exports the la package from svn and
      tar and bz2 it.
